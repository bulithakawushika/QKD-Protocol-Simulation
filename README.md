# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol Simulation with NetSquid

This repository provides **implementations and simulations of BB84, E91, and MDI-QKD quantum key distribution protocols** using the [NetSquid](https://netsquid.org/) discrete-event simulator.  
It is designed as a **research-oriented toolset** to simulate **realistic quantum communication networks**, focusing on **physical-layer imperfections, fiber-channel noise, and measurement device limitations**.

## üéØ Motivation

During my final year research project, I identified a major challenge in QKD research:  
> **There were no publicly available, accurate, and realistic QKD simulation codes.**  

Most open-source QKD simulators:  
- **Ignore realistic channel noise and photon loss**  
- **Simplify QKD logic** without true physical modeling  
- Lack modularity for research-level extension  

Implementing QKD experimentally requires **expensive hardware**:
- Single-photon sources, detectors, and entanglement devices  
- Precision optical fiber setups  
- Sophisticated synchronization and error correction systems  

This project was built to **bridge that gap** by providing:  
- **Physically realistic QKD simulations**  
- **Customizable models** of quantum devices and channels  
- **Research-ready modular code** for extending QKD protocols

## üß© Implemented QKD Protocols

| Protocol | Description | Reference |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **BB84** | The first QKD protocol (Bennett & Brassard, 1984), using **photon polarization states** to generate secure keys. | [Comprehensive Study of BB84](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370040044_Comprehensive_Study_of_BB84_A_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol) |
| **E91**  | Uses **entangled photon pairs** and Bell inequality tests for security verification, resistant to eavesdropping. | [Wikipedia - E91 Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution#E91_protocol:_Artur_Ekert_.281991.29) |

## üåê Simulation Network Setup

The simulations are configured for a **10 km optical fiber channel** between **Alice** and **Bob**, with the following roles:

- **Alice**: Prepares and transmits qubits using a quantum processor.  
- **Bob**: Measures incoming qubits using a quantum processor.  
- **Charlie (MDI-QKD)**: Performs **Bell-State Measurement (BSM)** to detect entanglement using a **CNOT + Hadamard measurement** sequence.  
- **Entanglement Source**: Generates entangled photon pairs for protocols like E91.  
- **Bell Parameter**: Derived from CHSH Bell inequality tests to verify non-classical correlations.
